# Snagshout SDK

The Snagshout SDK is a collection of libraries and code examples that allow
developers to build applications and websites that make use of the Snagshout
platform API.

As part of this SDK, we include a Swagger/OpenAPI specification of the API
methods available to our partners. This specification can be used to
automatically generate client libraries for many languages, and as a reference
point for anyone interacting with the API.

- **Swagger JSON:** https://sellerlabs.github.io/snagshout-sdk/swagger.json

- **Swagger UI:** The UI provides a graphical interface to explore the
  specification. You can use it to lookup the parameter and response types
  supported by each method. Note: While it supports making interactive
  requests, the Snagshout API does not currently have the required CORS headers
  to allow for interactive consoles to make requests:
